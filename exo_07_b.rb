#gets. chomp is used to take string input from users
#takes input from the user through the keyboard and store it in the variable

=begin
The differences betwen exo_07 a, b y c:
>a print a string before asking the user for an input
>b print the '>' symbol in the same line where the user have to type the input
>c show directly for the user input, without any string or symbol

All of them print the user input at the end of the program

=end
